# Springboot Project
This project is a spring application that creates six java models: consoles, games, invoices, t-shirts, fees, and taxes. It has four REST API's (consoles, games, invoices, t-shirts) with CRUD capabilities. It also has a database with tables for each java model. Each REST API has the ability to create, read, update, and delete instances of the class in the database. The project also implements GraphQL to allow users to use advanced search queries easily.

The project uses CI/CD practices with CircleCi. The database and back-end are running on AWS. Finally, the data stored in the management system is protected using OAuth.
